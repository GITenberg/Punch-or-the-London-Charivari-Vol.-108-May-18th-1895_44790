<p>Oh, "lark," which all the "Comiques" sing,</p>
<p class="i2">And every drunken rowdy pup, too;</p>
<p>Sure you're a vicious, vulgar thing</p>

<p class="ind1"><span class="sc">A Kind Offer.</span>&mdash;A lady who is not well
up in Parliamentary matters writes to us
saying that she has seen mentioned in the
papers "Mr. Speaker's Retirement Bill,"
and would very much like to know what the
amount is. Her admiration for the late
<span class="sc">Speaker</span> is so great that, our fair correspondent
goes on to say, she would willingly
defray the whole amount herself, or if the
total be too much for her pocket, then would
she cheerfully head a subscription list.
She is perfectly certain that Mr. <span class="sc">Peel</span> was
a very moderate man, and therefore the entire
sum cannot be very startling.</p>

<h2>RATHER "BOLD ADVERTISEMENT."</h2>

<p class="center">["Advertisements for some time past have been inserted in Government
publications."&mdash;<i>Daily Paper.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="sc">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>Room of a</i> Secretary of State. <i>Present</i> Right Hon.
Gentleman <i>attended by his</i> Private Secretary.</p>

<p><i>Right Hon. Gentleman.</i> Well, <span class="sc">Tenterfore</span>, anything for me this
morning?</p>

<p><i>Private Secretary.</i> I think not. You will find that I have worked
out the answers to to-day's questions&mdash;the list is not a very heavy
one, only a couple of dozen queries or thereabouts.</p>

<p><i>Rt. Hon. Gent.</i> That's right. Such a lot of time is wasted in that
sort of thing. And has anyone come for me?</p>

<p><i>Priv. Sec.</i> No one of importance. A fellow with a new invention
or something of that sort. Said you were extremely busy just now,
but that if he would write, his letter would receive the attention of
the department.</p>

<p><i>Rt. Hon. Gent.</i> Was he satisfied?</p>

<p><i>Priv. Sec.</i> (<i>smiling</i>). Well, I fear not entirely. I think he must
have had some experience of Government offices. He said he preferred
to see you personally.</p>

<p><i>Rt. Hon. Gent.</i> (<i>amused</i>). I daresay he would. Anyone else?</p>

<p><i>Priv. Sec.</i> Only a man about advertisements.</p>

<p><i>Rt. Hon. Gent.</i> (<i>aghast</i>). You did not send <i>him</i> away?</p>

<p><i>Priv. Sec.</i> Well, no. I believe he is still in the waiting-room.
But surely you don't want to see him?</p>

<p><i>Rt. Hon. Gent.</i> Of course I do. A most important person. Send
a messenger for him at once. (<i>Exit</i> Private Secretary.) That's the
worst of <span class="sc">Tenterfore</span>&mdash;so impulsive! Means well, but so very impulsive!
(<i>Knock.</i>) Ah, here comes my visitor. (<i>Enter stranger.</i>)
My very dear Sir, I am delighted to see you. (<i>He shakes hands
warmly and provides him with an arm-chair.</i>) I am sorry you
should have been detained&mdash;quite a mistake.</p>

<p><i>Stranger</i> (<i>surprised</i>). You are most kind. I come about some
advertisements.</p>

<p><i>Rt. Hon. Gent.</i> I know, my dear Sir, I know. Now what can
I tempt you with? You arrive at a most fortunate moment. We
are thinking of letting the sides of our cruisers for posters. The
Mediterranean fleet will be a most excellent medium. We can do
sixteen double crowns at a very reasonable rate; of course the
Admiral's flag-ship would be a trifle extra. Is your leading article
soap, pickles, or hair-dye?</p>

<p><i>Stranger.</i> I am afraid you do not understand me.</p>

<p><i>Rt. Hon. Gent.</i> Oh yes, I do; but, if you object to marine advertisements,
I think we can suit you on land. We have several commanding
positions on the colours of some of the most popular regiments
in the service vacant. (<i>Showing plans.</i>) You see we can
insert type&mdash;we object to blocks&mdash;on the material without interfering
with the badges or the victories. A most admirable medium,
I assure you.</p>

<p><i>Stranger.</i> You really are in error. I wish to say&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rt. Hon. Gent.</i> (<i>interrupting</i>). Yes, I know. You think that
something would be better. Well, we can put advertisements on
the backs of all petitions presented to Parliament, and let you out
hoardings in front of the more prominent of the Government offices.
How would that suit you?</p>

<p><i>Stranger.</i> Really, you must allow me to explain. Advertisements
of matters interesting to mariners&mdash;such as notices of wrecks&mdash;are
inserted solely in the <i>London Gazette</i> and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rt. Hon. Gent.</i> Ah, you are thinking of the sky signs. Well, of
course, we might utilise the lighthouses, but we have not quite made
up our minds whether such a course might not cause confusion in
misty weather.</p>

<p><i>Stranger.</i> I was going to propose that the Government might feel
inclined to insert the advertisements to which I have referred in a
paper with which I am connected, and which is extensively circulated
amongst seafaring men.</p>

<p><i>Rt. Hon. Gent.</i> (<i>astounded</i>). You want <i>me</i> to give <i>you</i>
an advertisement!
No, Sir; now that we have taken up advertisements we
insert them and don't give them out. (<i>Enter</i> Private Secretary.)
Mr. <span class="sc">Tenterfore</span>, be so good as to explain to this gentleman that my
time is valuable.</p>

<h2>FAIR CHILDREN IN GRAFTON STREET.</h2>

<p>A splendid show, though some of the children are neither fair nor
beautiful. Note No. 114, "<i>The Chinese Boy</i>," by Sir <span class="sc">Joshua</span>. He is
a
boy, certainly, but his complexion has a mahogany tinge not usually
associated with loveliness. <span class="sc">Catherine de Medicis</span>, if we may judge
by No. 67, was a plain, decent, housewifely body, with a family of
four horrors, three male and one female, all of whom, eventually,
wore a crown. Can it be possible that <i>La Reine Margot</i> ever looked
like <i>that?</i> If so, the great <span class="sc">Dumas</span> is convicted of gross deceit.
For
a screaming farce in oil, let the visitor look at No. 155, "<i>The Infant
Johnson</i>," by Sir <span class="sc">Joshua</span>. Some one has evidently suggested to the
baby lexicographer that he should have a bath. Naturally enough
he is furious at the idea. "Sir," he seems to say, "let us take a
perambulator down Fleet Street, or anywhere else, but let us not
bathe." Can there not be found a companion picture of the mighty
infant in a cheerful mood, prattling out a "What, nurse, are you
for a frolic? Then I'm with you." In a case labelled No. 454 are
to be seen toys, dolls, and playthings found in Children's Tombs in
Egypt. Here, too, is the "<i>Mummy of a Baby</i>." "I see the
baby," observed an intelligent child-visitor; "but where is its
Mummy? <i>My</i> Mummy never ties baby up like that."</p>

<hr class="medium" />

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">Not Due North.</span>&mdash;The <i>North British Daily Mail</i>, referring to
the rumour that the Prince of <span class="sc">Wales</span> may go to New York in the
autumn to see the contest for the America Cup, says: "There will be
better racing on the Clyde than there was last year. Let the <span class="sc">Prince</span>

Clyde will be a good one. But our Scottish contemporary forgets
that a visit to the United States on the part of H.R.H. would be to
the advantage of two races&mdash;the American and the British. It would
be sure to cause good feeling on either side of the Atlantic. Why
should not Caledonia wait?</p>

at the Newspaper Society's Dinner the other evening. His compliments
to the Press were in every way deserved.</p>

<p><i>Jones</i> (<i>also reading a journal</i>). Quite so. I am glad to see that
the admirable publication I am now devouring objects to gambling
in all its branches.</p>

<p><i>Brown.</i> So does this. There is an excellent leader on the fourth
page exposing the scandals of the Stock Exchange.</p>

<p><i>Jones.</i> And here I find on page two a most earnest attack upon the
abuses of the turf.</p>

<p><i>Brown.</i> Such intelligent comments should do a world of good.</p>

<p><i>Jones.</i> I am sure of it. I know, speaking for myself, I feel much
better after perusing a column that might have supplied the pabulum
of a sermon.</p>

<p><i>Brown.</i> Just my case. It really strengthens one's moral perceptions
to come across such noble sentiments. Well, as we have both
read the leaders, let us exchange papers.</p>

<p><i>Jones.</i> With pleasure, only I want just to glance at the latest odds.
This journal gives the latest information on all matters connected
with racing and the turf generally.</p>

<p><i>Brown.</i> Just so, that is why I wanted to read it. Well, I must
fill up the time by looking at the money article. Commend me to
the city editor of this favourite production when you want to have a
gentle flutter!</p>

<h3>EXPECTEDNESS.</h3>

<p class="ind">"Inevitable" is the new cant
phrase, and certain phrases <i>are</i>
inevitable, it would seem.</p>

<p class="ind">It is inevitable, if you should
happen to beg the pardon of one
of the lower middle class, that he
(or more generally <i>she</i>) will reply
with "Granted!"</p>

<p class="ind">It is inevitable, if you converse
with a young Oxonian of immature
intellect, that he will murder the
<span class="sc">Queen's</span>, or (as he would call it)
Quagger's, English by some such
expression as "What a beastly
sensagger!" or invite you to
"stagger for the dagger" (<i>i.e.</i>
stay for the day). But competent
authorities are inclined to think
that this laborious form of undergraduate
wit, or "wagger," is
doomed to speedy "extigger."</p>

<p class="ind">It is inevitable that the would-be
smart business person, when
inditing a circular or club notice,
will say, "Forward <i>same</i>," or, "I
inclose <i>same</i>," instead of "<i>it</i>,"
whatever it may happen to be.</p>

<p class="ind">It is inevitable that, when <span class="sc">'Arry</span>
wishes to be familiarly polite at
parting, he will take his leave
with "So long."</p>

<p class="ind">It is inevitable that, when a
young City man desires to express
his disapproval of any individual
or thing, he will dismiss it as
"no class."</p>

<p class="ind">It is inevitable, if you make
any surprising or absurd statement
to a Yankee, that his comment
thereon will be, "Is that so!"</p>

<p class="ind">It is inevitable, if you meet an
actor "resting" in the Strand,
that he will ask you to "Name
it," and you will proceed to do so
(possibly at your own expense) at
one or more of the excellent
drinking-bars in that locality.</p>

<blockquote><p>
<span class="sc">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>Interior of one of the Royal Courts. Customary occupants
and surroundings.</i> Witness <i>in the box undergoing cross-examination</i>.
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>First Counsel.</i> And now will you give me the name of the person
you met on that occasion?</p>

<p><i>Second Counsel.</i> I do not wish to interfere without reason; but
surely it is unnecessary to introduce third parties into this inquiry.</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i> Perhaps I might follow the plan I adopted in my
examination-in-chief
and write the name on a piece of paper?</p>

<p><i>The Judge.</i> That seems a reasonable course to pursue.</p>

<p><i>First Counsel.</i> As your Lordship pleases. Then be so good as to
give me the name as suggested. (Witness <i>complies</i>.) Thank you.
(<i>After reading the paper.</i>) Do you spell the name with a final "e"?</p>

<p><i>Second Counsel.</i> Really, my learned friend is carrying matters too
far. If the anonymity of third parties is to be preserved, such a
leading question would reveal the identity at once.</p>

<p><i>The Judge.</i> I suppose you mean that the query about the final "e"
would indicate that the veiled name was "<span class="sc">Browne</span>."</p>

<p><i>Second Counsel.</i> Quite so, my lord; that is a conclusion that would
be accepted by persons of the most ordinary intelligence.</p>

<p><i>First Counsel.</i> But as a matter of fact, the name to which I refer
is certainly neither <span class="sc">Brown</span> nor <span class="sc">Browne</span>.
I will submit the paper to your lordship.</p>

<p><i>The Judge</i> (<i>after perusing the slip which has been handed to him
by an usher</i>). Dear me! I am greatly surprised!</p>

<p><i>Foreman of the Jury.</i> May we, my lord, learn the name?</p>

<p><i>First Counsel.</i> So far as I am concerned, I shall be only too pleased
to allow the Gentlemen of the Jury to have the fullest information on
the point.</p>

<p><i>Second Counsel.</i> If I object, it is not because I have not the greatest
confidence in the Jury's discretion, but simply as a matter of principle.</p>

<p><i>First Counsel.</i> I do not see how the affair is a matter of principle,
but if my learned friend objects I have no wish to push the point
further. (<i>Turning to</i> Witness.) And now, where did you meet this
person whose name we have arranged to leave undiscovered?</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i> Perhaps you will allow me to write the locality on a
piece of paper and pass it round?</p>

<p><i>The Judge.</i> I think we may do that.</p>

<p><i>First Counsel.</i> As your Lordship pleases. (<i>Course suggested
pursued.</i>) And now, have you ever seen any one else on the subject?</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i> Certainly. (<i>Produces a scroll.</i>) Here is a list. I have
purposely written their names in shorthand, so that they may only
be recognised by those who have a knowledge of <span class="sc">Pitman's</span> method.</p>

<p><i>The Judge.</i> Certainly.</p>

<p><i>First Counsel.</i> And that, my Lord, is my case.</p>

<p class="rindent1">[<i>Sits down.</i></p>

<p><i>The Judge.</i> And now, Gentlemen, before we proceed further, I
would like to make a suggestion. When we commenced this trial we
arranged that the names of the Plaintiff and Defendant should not
be made public. Since then it seems to me that we should learn
them. What do you say, Gentlemen?</p>

<p><i>Foreman of the Jury.</i> We share your Lordship's curiosity.</p>

<p><i>The Judge</i> (<i>addressing Counsel</i>). You hear.</p>

<p><i>First Counsel</i> (<i>after consultation with his opponent</i>). My Lord,
I need scarcely say that both my friend and myself are most
anxious to meet the wishes of your Lordship. But as this is a
point of great importance to our clients, we should like to have an
opportunity of consulting them. No doubt the names asked for
might only have a limited circulation&mdash;be known only to your
Lordship and the Gentlemen of the Jury. Still there are objections
to even so partial a publication as I have shadowed forth which make
it most desirable that we should have an opportunity of giving the
matter our fullest consideration. Perhaps we might adjourn until
to-morrow morning?</p>

<p><i>The Judge.</i> Oh, certainly, certainly.</p>

<h2>A LITTLE CHANGE.</h2>

<p>Hang it all! They have blocked the street and are laying it with
asphalte; just in May, as usual. From early morning the quiet of
my rooms is disturbed by the noise of the work, when I go out I
scramble over heaps of rubbish, past smoking cauldrons of pitch, and
when I come home at night my cab drops me nearly a quarter of a
mile away. Moreover, one neighbouring house is being painted, and
the other is being rebuilt. I fly from falling dust and brickbats, only
to run against ladders and paint-pots. It is awful. And now my
Aunt <span class="sc">Jane</span> is coming up from Bath, and has invited herself to tea at
my chambers. Her rheumatism prevents her from walking more
than a yard or two, she cannot bear any noise, and the smell of paint
makes her ill. She is very rich, and could leave all she has to the
poor. Accurately speaking, that class includes me, but in my aunt's
opinion it does not. She is very suspicious, and, if I made excuses
and invited her to tea anywhere else, she would feel convinced that I
was hiding some guilty secret in my dull, quiet, respectable rooms.
She is very prim, and the mere suggestion of such a thing would
alienate her from me for ever. Why on earth can't she stop in
Bath? And I shall have to go with her to May meetings! It is impossible;
I must fly. But where? She has a horror and suspicion of
all foreign nations, except perhaps the steady, industrious Swiss.
Good idea&mdash;Switzerland. But what reason can I give for rushing off
just now? Someone must send me. I have it. She knows I try to
write a little, so I will say my editor requires me to go at once to
Geneva to write a series of articles in the Jardin Alpin d'Acclimatation
on Alpine botany. Botany, how respectable! Geneva, how
sedate! Makes one think at once of <span class="sc">Calvin</span> and Geneva bands.
These sound rather frivolous, something like German bands, but they
are not really so, only, I believe, a sort of clerical cravat. Then I
will start off to Paris, the direct way to Geneva.</p>

<p>Perhaps I shall never reach Geneva. Paris will do well enough.
No streets there taken up in the Spring. No painting on the clean
stone houses. No rebuilding on the Boulevards. No aunt of mine
anywhere near. I shall escape all my troubles. I shall be able to
smoke my cigarette lazily in the pleasant courtyard of the Grand
Hôtel, and try to imagine that I see some of the people in
<i>Trilby</i>&mdash;<i>Little
Billee</i>, or <i>Taffy</i>, or the <i>Laird</i>&mdash;amongst the animated,
cosmopolitan
crowd. And the stately giant in the gilt chain will solemnly
arrange the newspapers in all languages, and will supply me with
note-paper. I must be careful not to write to my aunt a long description
of the Jardin Alpin d'Acclimatation de Geneve on paper
stamped "Grand Hôtel, Paris." And the attentive <span class="sc">Joseph</span>, with
those long grey whiskers, sacred to the elderly French waiter and
the elderly French lawyer, will exclaim, "<i>V'là, M'sieu!</i>" in all
those varied tones which make the two syllables mean "Yessir!"
"Coming, Sir!" "Here is your coffee, Sir!" "In a minute, Sir!"
and so many things besides. And I shall be able to watch,
assembled from all parts of the world, some younger and prettier
faces than my Aunt <span class="sc">Jane's</span>. That settles it. A regretful letter to
my aunt. And to-morrow <i>en route!</i></p>

<p>Gentlemen of the Jury, for the
last couple of years or so you have
no doubt read any number of denunciations
of the conduct of the
man whose actions you are now
about to investigate. You have
heard him abused right and left.
You have seen pictures of him, in
which he has been held up to
scorn and public ridicule. You
have heard it announced in all
quarters that he is a scoundrel
and a thief. And as this has
been the case, Gentlemen of the
Jury, it is my duty to tell you
that you must put aside the recollection
of these attacks. You
must treat the prisoner before
you as if he were immaculate.
In fact you must lay aside all
prejudice, and give the man a
fair trial; and, Gentlemen, it is
my duty (sanctioned by precedent)
to have the pleasure of informing
you that I am sure you will!
Yes, Gentlemen of the Jury,
having regard to all the circumstances
of the case, I repeat, I
am sure you will!</p>

<h3>A MAY MEETING.</h3>

<div class="poem width24">  <div class="stanza">
<p>They met in a cake-shop hard by the Strand,</p>
<p class="i2">He in black broadcloth, and she in silk.</p>
<p>She had a glass of "fizz" in her hand,</p>
<p class="i2">He had a bun and a cup of milk.</p>
<p>She had a sunshade of burnished crimson,</p>
<p class="i2">He had a brolly imperfectly furled,</p>
<p>And a pair of <i>pince-nez</i> with tortoiseshell rims on.</p>
<p class="i2">He looked the Church, and she seemed the World.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>They sat on each side of a marble table,</p>
<p class="i2">His legs were curled round the legs of his chair.</p>
<p>Around them babbled a miniature Babel;</p>
<p class="i2">The sunlight gleamed on her coppery hair.</p>
<p>She held a crumpled Academy Guide,</p>
<p class="i2">Scored with crosses in bold blacklead;</p>
<p>A pile of leaflets lay at his side,</p>
<p class="i2">And he grasped a Report, which he gravely read.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>His shaven lip was pendulous, long,</p>
<p class="i2">Her mouth was a cherry-hued <i>moue mutine</i>,</p>
<p>His complacent, uncomely, strong,</p>
<p class="i2">Hers soft appetence sharpened with spleen.</p>
<p>Her eyes scale-glitter, his oyster-dim,</p>
<p class="i2">His huge mouth hardened, her small lips curled</p>
<p>As he gazed at her and she glanced at him;</p>
<p class="i2">He looked the Church, and she seemed the World.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>"A holy spouter from Exeter Hall!"</p>
<p class="i2">(So she mused as she sipped her wine.)</p>
<p>"A butterfly in the Belial thrall</p>
<p class="i2">Of Vanity Fair, all tinkle and shine!"</p>
<p>So thought he as he crumbled his bun</p>
<p class="i2">With clumsy fingers in loose black cloth;</p>
<p>And the impish spirit of genial fun</p>
<p class="i2">Hovered about them and mocked them both.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Mutual ignorance, mutual scorn,</p>
<p class="i2">Revealed in glances aflame though fleeting;</p>
<p>Such, in the glow of this glad May morn,</p>
<p class="i2">The inhuman spirit of mortal meeting.</p>
<p>The worm must disparage the butterfly,</p>
<p class="i2">The butterfly must despise the worm;</p>
<p>And Scorn, the purblind, will ne'er descry</p>
<p class="i2">A common bond, or a middle term.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Modish folly, factitious Art?</p>
<p class="i2">True, grave homilist, sadly true!</p>
<p>But <i>Boanerges</i> truculent, tart,</p>
<p class="i2">What of the part that is played by you?</p>
<p>You denouncing the "Snare of Beauty,"</p>
<p class="i2">She affecting to feel its spell,&mdash;</p>
<p>Which falls shortest of human duty?</p>
<p class="i2">Shallow censor, can <i>you</i> quite tell?</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Meanwhile the lilac is blithely budding,</p>
<p class="i2">And sweetly breatheth the nutty May,</p>
<p>The golden sunshine the earth is flooding,</p>
<p class="i2">And you&mdash;you echo the old, old bray</p>
<p>Of <i>Boanerges</i>. A broader greeting</p>
<p class="i2">Of brotherhood full, warm hearts, wide eyes</p>
<p>Might lend a meaning to your "May Meeting"</p>
<p class="i2">To gladden the gentle and win the wise.</p>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, May 6.</i>&mdash;Welsh Disestablishment
Bill on. So is The Man from Shropshire. <span class="sc">Stanley Leighton</span>, as
<span class="sc">George Trevelyan</span> pointed out long ago, is irresistibly like the
ruined Chancery Suitor of <i>Bleak House</i>. Always dashing into debate
as The Man from Shropshire broke in on the business of the Court of Chancery.
"Mr. Chairman!" he shouts, and waves his arms, as The Man from Shropshire
cried aloud, "My lord! My lord!" and tried to seize the Lord Chancellor
by wig or neck. After first ebullition, our Man from Shropshire
quietens down. Argues with gravity of tone and manner that seem to imply
he has something to say. Turns out he hasn't; but, on the Welsh Disestablishment
Bill, that no matter.</p>

<p>Curious how this Church Bill brings to the front men who, if heard
at all, certainly do not speak in chorus on any other question. After
The Man from Shropshire comes <span class="sc">Tomlinson</span>, who, early in proceedings,
displays irresistible tendency to discuss points of order with
<span class="sc">Speaker</span>. New <span class="sc">Speaker</span> has, however, already got hand in, and,
before <span class="sc">Tomlinson</span>, who remembers being on his feet addressing Chair,
quite knows where he is, he finds himself sitting down again, <span class="sc">Cranborne</span>
also on warpath, his very hair bristling with indignation at this
fresh attack on the Church. Glib <span class="sc">Griffith-Boscawen</span>
has a field-night; makes long speech on moving Instruction
standing in his own name. His obvious, unaffected enjoyment of his
own oratory should be infectious; but isn't.</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="sc">Lockwood</span>, that pillar of the Church, was
the first called on in Committee to move amendment.
Colonel not in his place. Report has it the devout
man is in library reading <span class="sc">Thomas À Kempis</span>, or <span class="sc">Drelincourt</span>
on Death. Here is opportunity for <span class="sc">Glib-Griffith</span>
to make another speech. Dashes in; starting
off with promise of good half-hour; desire for <span class="sc">Lockwood's</span>
appearance irresistible. As <span class="sc">Addison</span> says, with
hereditary disposition to drop into poetry, and the belief
that he is quoting <span class="sc">Tennyson</span>,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>[pg 240]</span></p>

<div class="poem width18">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Better fifty words from <span class="sc">Lockwood</span></p>
<p>Than a thousand from <span class="sc">Boscawen</span>.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Scouts sent out in all directions. The Colonel discovered in sort of
oratory he has contrived in far recess of library. Brought back to
House; found <span class="sc">Boscawen</span> bowling along. "This is my show," said
the Colonel as he passed <span class="sc">Boscawen</span> on his way to his seat. More
fierceness in his eye than befit the man or the occasion. <span class="sc">Boscawen</span>
stared over his head, and went on with his speech. Opportunity too
precious to be lost. If <span class="sc">Lockwood</span> meant to move his amendment he
should have been there when called upon. He wasn't: <span class="sc">Boscawen</span>
found it, so to speak, by roadside. Now it was his; would make
the most of it; pegged along whilst the Colonel muttered remarks
as he glared upon him. Some who sat by said it was a prayer.
Others, catching a word here and there, said it was a quotation from
<span class="sc">Thomas À Kempis</span>. Whatever it might have been, Colonel seemed
much moved. Hardly pacified when, at end of twenty minutes,
<span class="sc">Glib-Griffith</span> sat down, and <span class="sc">Lockwood</span>, finding himself in
peculiar
position of seconding his own amendment, delivered the speech he
had prepared for moving it.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Got into Committee on Welsh Disestablishment
Bill.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Pretty to see <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span> drop down on <span class="sc">George
Russell</span> just now for speaking
disrespectfully of <span class="sc">Silomio</span>. That
eminent patriot, having in his
newly-assumed character of Patron
Saint of Japan, cross-examined
<span class="sc">Edward Grey</span> upon latest Treaty
negotiations, accused <span class="sc">Asquith</span> of
nothing less than stealing a county.
"Filching" was precise word,
which has its equivalent in Slang
Dictionary in sneaking. Idea of
<span class="sc">Home Secretary</span> hovering over
the Marches in dead of night, and,
when he thought no one was looking,
picking up Monmouthshire,
and putting it in his coat-tail
pocket, amused scanty audience.
But <span class="sc">Silomio</span> really wrath. "Always
Anti-English this Government,"
he exclaimed, with scornful
sweep of red right hand along line
of smiling faces on Treasury Bench.
"A stirring burst of British patriotism,"
<span class="sc">George Russell</span> characterised
it. <span class="sc">John Bull</span> <i>in
excelsis</i>. The more notable since,
on reference to official record, he
found the Knight from Sheffield
was born in the United States,
and descended from the Pilgrim
Fathers.</p>

<p>"Which one?" inquired voice
from back bench, an inquiry very
properly disregarded. (A new
phrase this, <span class="sc">Sark</span> notes, for use by
retired tradesmen, setting up to spend rest of useful lives in retirement
at Clapham or Camberwell. To trace their family tree back to
transplantation at period of Conquest, played out. Instead of
"Came over with the Conqueror," newer, more picturesque, equally
historical to say, "Came over with the Pilgrim Fathers.")</p>

<p><span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span> not in mood for speculation of this kind. Cut to
the heart by remarks he suspected of slighting intent towards his
friend and colleague. In <span class="sc">Silomio Prince Arthur</span> has long learned
to recognise all the graces and all the talents. Apart from personal
consideration, he feels how much the Party owe to him for having
raised within its ranks the standard of culture and conduct. To have
him attacked, even in fun, by an Under Secretary, was more than
he could stand. So, in gravest tone, with no flicker of a smile on his
expressive countenance, he declared that a more unfortunate speech
he had never heard. "If the hon. gentleman intends," he added,
"to take a considerable part in debate, I would earnestly recommend
him either to change the character of his humour, or entirely
to repress the exhibition."</p>

<p>Beautiful! In its way, all things considered, best thing <span class="sc">Prince
Arthur</span> has done this Session. House grinned; but two big hot
tears coursed down cheek of <span class="sc">Silomio</span>, making deep furrows in the
war paint.</p>

<p>"That's tit for tat with <span class="sc">Georgie Russell</span>," said <span class="sc">Herbert
Gardner</span> to <span class="sc">Solicitor-General</span>, with vague recollection of a
historic phrase.</p>

<p>"Quite perfect," said <span class="sc">Lockwood</span>. "But what a loss the stage
has sustained by <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span> taking to politics? Tried both
myself and know something about it." <i>Business done.</i>&mdash;An eight
hours day with Welsh Disestablishment Bill.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a href="images/240-980.png"><img src="images/240-450.png" width="450" height="482" alt="Piling Peeler upon Rossa!" /></a>
<p class="center">Piling Peeler upon Rossa!</p></div>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Tanner's</span> curiosity inconveniently uncontrollable.
At end of sitting given up to Scotland no one thinking about
<span class="sc">Commander-in-Chief</span> or <span class="sc">Tanner</span> either. Successive divisions had
carried sitting far beyond midnight, that blessed hour at which, in
ordinary circumstances, debate stands adjourned. Quarter of an hour
occupied in dividing on question whether they should divide on amendment.
Proposal affirmed; another quarter of an hour spent in fresh
division. Nothing possible further to be done, Members streamed
forth, scrambling for cabs in Palace Yard. <span class="sc">Conybeare</span> in charge of
a Bill dealing with false alarms of fire, managed to get it through
Committee unopposed. Members little recked how near they were to
real alarm of worse than fire.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes earlier, when last division taken, over 330
Members filled House. Now the tide ebbed; only the thirty odd
Members in their places jealously watching <span class="sc">Speaker</span> running through
Orders of the Day. <span class="sc">Tanner</span> bobbing up and down on bench like
parched pea. Heard it somewhere whispered that Duke of <span class="sc">Cambridge</span>,
worn out with long campaign, about to unhelm, unbuckle
his sword, hang up his dinted armour. <span class="sc">Tanner</span> feels he can't go to
bed leaving unsettled the problem of truth or phantasy. Not a
moment to be lost. <span class="sc">Speaker</span> risen to put question "That this House
do now adjourn." Then <span class="sc">Tanner</span> blurts out the inquiry, "Is it
true?" "Order! order!" says
the <span class="sc">Speaker</span>. Well, if they didn't
like the question in the form he
had first put it, he would try
again.</p>

<p>"I would ask," he said, adopting
conditional mood as least likely to
hurt anyone's feelings, "whether
a member of the Royal Family
who has really" (most desirous of
not putting it too strongly, but
really you know) "been drawing
public money too long is going to
retire?"</p>

<p>"Order! order!" roared the few
Members present.</p>

<p>"I would ask that question,"
repeated <span class="sc">Tanner</span>, still in the conditional
mood, but nodding confidentially
all round.</p>

<p>The Blameless <span class="sc">Bartley</span> happily
at post of duty. Broke in with
protest. <span class="sc">Speaker</span> ruled question
out of order. But the good <span class="sc">Tanner</span>
came back like a bad sixpence.</p>

<p>"Is his Royal Highness going
to retire?" he insisted, getting redder
than ever in the face. "Order!
order!" shouted Members in chorus.
Thus encouraged, <span class="sc">Tanner</span> sang out
the solo again, "Is his Royal Highness
going to retire?"</p>

<p>That was his question. The
<span class="sc">Speaker</span>, distinctly differing,
affirmed "The question is that the
House do now adjourn;" which it did straightway, leaving Dr.
<span class="sc">Tanner</span> to go to a sleepless bed haunted by an unanswered question.</p>

<p>"What I should like," said Lieut.-General Sir <span class="sc">Frederick Wellington
Fitz Wygram</span>, who served in the Crimea with H.R.H., has
been in command of the Cavalry Brigade at Aldershot, and in other
positions come in personal contact with the <span class="sc">Commander-in-Chief</span>,
"What I should like," he repeated reflectively, stroking his chin,
"would be the opportunity, enjoyed from a safe distance, of hearing
the Dook personally reply to <span class="sc">Tanner's</span> interrogation."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Wrangle all night round Scotch Committee.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Squire</span> sat through dull morning sitting listening with
air of pathetic resignation to Members talking round Budget. <span class="sc">Quilter</span>
led off with prodigiously long paper on the Art of Brewing Beer.
Seems they fill up the cup with all kinds of mysterious ingredients.
<span class="sc">Brookfield</span>, looking round and observing both <span class="sc">Joseph</span> and
<span class="sc">Jesse</span>
absent, whispered in ear of sympathetic Chairman that Birmingham
has reputation in the Trade of making and drinking beer containing
minimum of malt, maximum of sugar, and warranted to do the
greatest damage to the system. <span class="sc">Squire</span>, momentarily waking up
from mournful mood, observed that Birmingham is also headquarters
of Liberal Unionism. Might be nothing in coincidence, but
there it was. <span class="sc">Rasch</span> posed as the distressed agriculturist.
<span class="sc">Jokim</span>
tried to walk on both sides of road at same time, and Government
got majority of 24. <i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Budget Resolutions agreed to.</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
